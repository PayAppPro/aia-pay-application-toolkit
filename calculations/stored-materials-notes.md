# Stored Materials Notes

Materials presently stored are one of the most misunderstood parts of AIA-style pay applications.  
They affect cash flow, retainage, and percent complete calculations, and they are often subject to stricter review than installed work.

This document explains how stored materials are **commonly treated in practice**, with an emphasis on consistency and clarity.

## What Are Stored Materials?

Stored materials are materials that:
- Have been purchased for the project
- Are not yet installed
- Are stored either on-site or off-site
- Are eligible for billing under the contract

Stored materials are **not the same** as work completed.

---

## When Stored Materials Are Allowed

Whether stored materials can be billed depends on:
- Contract language
- Owner or GC requirements
- Documentation provided

Common requirements include:
- Proof of purchase
- Storage location details
- Insurance coverage
- Clear identification as project-specific materials

Billing stored materials without meeting requirements is a frequent cause of rejection.

## How Stored Materials Appear on the G703

On a G703-style continuation sheet:
- Stored materials are listed separately from installed work
- They are added to “Total Completed and Stored to Date”
- They contribute to earned value but not physical progress

Percent complete should reflect **installed work**, not stored materials alone.

---

## Stored Materials and Percent Complete

A common mistake is inflating percent complete based on stored materials.

Best practice:
- Percent complete reflects installed work only
- Stored materials increase earned value, not physical completion

Misaligned percentages are easy to spot during review.

---

## Retainage on Stored Materials

Retainage treatment varies widely:
- Full retainage
- Reduced retainage
- No retainage

Regardless of the rule:
- Apply it consistently
- Apply it at the line-item level
- Document the approach clearly

Inconsistent retainage treatment is more problematic than the percentage itself.

---

## Stored Materials and Final Billing

At final billing:
- Stored materials should typically be fully installed
- Remaining stored materials raise questions during closeout

Final applications that still include stored materials are often delayed.

---

## Common Stored Materials Mistakes

- Billing stored materials as completed work
- Failing to provide required documentation
- Applying retainage inconsistently
- Inflating percent complete
- Carrying stored materials into final billing

Most issues stem from misunderstanding, not intent.

---

## Best Practices

- Confirm stored material rules before the first pay application
- Track stored materials separately from installed work
- Apply retainage consistently
- Reconcile stored materials before final billing
- Keep documentation organized and accessible

Clarity prevents delays.
