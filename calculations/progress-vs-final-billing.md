# Progress Billing vs Final Billing

Progress billing and final billing follow the same basic structure, but they are **not the same**.  
Most billing issues near the end of a project happen because teams treat the final pay application like just another progress draw.

This document explains the practical differences between **progress** and **final** billing in AIA-style workflows.

---

## What Is Progress Billing?

Progress billing occurs throughout the life of the project and reflects:
- Work completed to date
- Materials presently stored (if allowed)
- Retainage withheld

Each progress pay application:
- Builds on the prior approved application
- Leaves a balance to finish
- Accumulates retainage

Progress billing answers the question:
> “How much of the contract has been earned so far?”

---

## What Is Final Billing?

Final billing represents the **closeout** of the contract.

A final pay application typically indicates:
- All contract work is complete
- All SOV line items are fully billed
- Remaining retainage is being released (if permitted)
- The balance to finish is zero

Final billing answers the question:
> “Is the contract complete and ready to close?”

## Structural Differences

| Area | Progress Billing | Final Billing |
|-----|------------------|---------------|
| Balance to finish | Greater than zero | Zero |
| Percent complete | Less than 100% | 100% |
| Retainage | Withheld | Released (partially or fully) |
| Punch list | Outstanding | Complete or addressed |
| Prior payments | Accumulating | Fully reconciled |

---

## Retainage Treatment

During progress billing:
- Retainage is withheld on each application
- Retainage held to date increases over time

During final billing:
- Retainage is typically released
- The release may occur:
  - On the final application, or
  - On a separate retainage release application

Final billing should clearly document how retainage is being handled.

---

## Stored Materials at Final Billing

Stored materials generally:
- Should be fully incorporated into the work by final billing
- Should no longer appear as “stored” at project closeout

Leaving stored materials on a final application is a common red flag.

---

## Change Orders and Final Billing

Before final billing:
- All approved change orders should be reflected in the SOV
- Contract sums should reconcile exactly
- No pending scope should remain unaddressed

Final billing is not the time to introduce new scope or corrections.

---

## Common Final Billing Mistakes

- Submitting a final application with a remaining balance to finish
- Forgetting to release retainage
- Leaving line items partially complete
- Carrying stored materials into final billing
- Using progress billing assumptions for a final application

Most final billing rejections are due to **incomplete reconciliation**, not missing signatures.

---

## Best Practices

- Reconcile the SOV before starting final billing
- Ensure all line items reach 100%
- Confirm retainage release requirements
- Verify G703 and G702 totals match exactly
- Perform a full review before submission

Final billing should feel boring — that usually means it’s correct.
