# Schedule of Values (SOV) Explained

The **Schedule of Values (SOV)** is the backbone of every AIA-style pay application. It defines how the total contract amount is broken into individual, billable components and serves as the reference point for all progress billing.

If the SOV is wrong, every G703 and G702 that follows will also be wrong.

## What Is a Schedule of Values?

A Schedule of Values is a line-item list that:
- Breaks the contract sum into billable parts
- Assigns a dollar value to each part
- Totals exactly to the contract amount

Each SOV line item becomes a row on the **G703 Continuation Sheet**, and progress is measured against these values throughout the project.

Once approved, the SOV typically remains fixed for the duration of the job, with changes handled through formal change orders.

---

## Why the SOV Matters

The SOV controls:
- How progress is measured
- What can be billed each month
- How retainage is calculated
- How balances to finish are tracked

A poorly constructed SOV creates friction, confusion, and rejected pay applications.

## Common Ways to Structure an SOV

There is no single “correct” SOV format, but common approaches include:

### 1. Trade-Based SOV
- Concrete
- Structural steel
- Electrical
- Mechanical

Best for projects with clearly separated scopes.

### 2. Phase-Based SOV
- Mobilization
- Rough-in
- Finish work
- Punch list

Often used on projects where labor phases matter more than trade separation.

### 3. Hybrid SOV
Combines trades and phases where necessary.

The goal is clarity and billability, not perfection.

## How Detailed Should an SOV Be?

A good rule of thumb:
- **Too broad** → billing becomes vague and contentious
- **Too detailed** → admin burden and constant rounding issues

Each line item should:
- Represent a meaningful portion of work
- Be billable over time
- Have a value that can be reasonably earned as work progresses

---

## SOV and Progress Billing

Each month, progress is tracked against the SOV by:
- Prior work completed
- Current period work
- Materials presently stored (if allowed)
- Total completed and stored to date

Billing **cannot exceed** the scheduled value of the line item.

Percent complete should always align with the dollar amounts billed.

---

## SOV and Retainage

Retainage is typically:
- Applied at the line-item level
- Calculated as a percentage of completed work (and sometimes stored materials)

A clear SOV ensures retainage is:
- Applied consistently
- Released correctly at project closeout
- Traceable during audits or disputes

---

## Common SOV Mistakes

- Line items that do not add up to the contract value
- Missing scope that cannot be billed later
- Using lump sums for complex scopes
- Changing SOV values mid-project without approval
- Misaligning SOV structure with how work is actually performed

Most downstream billing problems can be traced back to the SOV.

---

## Best Practices

- Build the SOV early and review it carefully
- Align line items with how the job will actually be built
- Avoid “catch-all” line items
- Keep descriptions clear and unambiguous
- Get formal approval before submitting your first pay app

---

## Relationship to G702 and G703

- **G703** uses the SOV as its line-item framework
- **G702** summarizes totals derived from the G703

Any mismatch between SOV values and G703 calculations will surface immediately on the G702.
