# What Are AIA G702 and G703?

AIA G702 and G703 are commonly used forms in the construction industry to submit **monthly progress payment applications**. Together, they provide a standardized way to show how much work has been completed, how much is being billed, and how that billing aligns with the contract value.

## How G702 and G703 Work Together

Think of the two forms as a pair:

- **G703 (Continuation Sheet)**  
  Contains the *detailed line-item breakdown* of the work performed.
- **G702 (Application and Certificate for Payment)**  
  Summarizes totals from the G703 into a single payment request.

The math always flows **from G703 → G702**, never the other way around.

## What Is AIA G703?

The **G703 Continuation Sheet** is where the actual billing logic lives. It is built around the **Schedule of Values (SOV)** and tracks progress at the line-item level.

Typical G703 columns include:
- Item number
- Description of work
- Scheduled value
- Work completed from previous applications
- Work completed this period
- Materials presently stored
- Total completed and stored to date
- Percent complete
- Balance to finish
- Retainage

Each row represents a portion of the contract value defined in the SOV.

## What Is AIA G702?

The **G702 Application and Certificate for Payment** is a summary form. It rolls up totals from the G703 and presents them in a format suitable for approval by the owner, architect, or construction manager.

G702 typically includes:
- Original contract sum
- Approved change orders
- Total contract sum to date
- Total completed and stored to date
- Retainage withheld
- Previous payments
- Current payment due
- Balance to finish

While the G702 is often what gets signed, it is entirely dependent on the accuracy of the G703.

## What Is a Schedule of Values (SOV)?

The **Schedule of Values** is the foundation of both forms.

It is a list of all billable components of the project, each assigned a dollar value that adds up to the total contract amount. Once approved, the SOV generally remains fixed and is used throughout the life of the project.

Common SOV issues include:
- Line items that are too broad
- Values that do not align with actual work phases
- Missing scope elements that cannot be billed later

Mistakes in the SOV propagate into every pay application.

---

## Common G702/G703 Mistakes

- Billing more than a line item’s scheduled value
- Incorrect retainage calculations
- Confusing stored materials with completed work
- Percent complete not matching dollar values
- G702 totals not matching G703 totals

Most rejected pay applications fail due to **math or consistency errors**, not missing signatures.

---

## Why Accuracy Matters

Errors in G702/G703 submissions can lead to:
- Delayed payments
- Rejected applications
- Extra review cycles
- Strained relationships with owners or GCs

Clear structure, consistent math, and disciplined SOV management are essential.
