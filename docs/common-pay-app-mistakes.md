# Common Pay Application Mistakes

Most rejected AIA-style pay applications fail for the same reasons every month.  
They are rarely rejected due to missing signatures — they are rejected due to **math, structure, or consistency errors**.

Understanding these common mistakes can save time, prevent payment delays, and reduce friction with owners and general contractors.

## 1. Schedule of Values Does Not Match the Contract

The most fundamental mistake is submitting pay applications against an SOV that:
- Does not total to the contract amount
- Omits approved scope
- Includes unapproved scope

If the SOV is wrong, every G703 and G702 that follows will also be wrong.

---

## 2. Billing Beyond the Scheduled Value

Each SOV line item has a maximum value that **cannot be exceeded**.

Common causes:
- Incorrect percent complete entries
- Manual math errors
- Forgetting prior billing amounts

Once a line item reaches 100%, it should not be billed again.

## 3. G702 Totals Do Not Match G703 Totals

G702 values are summaries derived from the G703.  
If the numbers do not match exactly, the application will almost always be rejected.

This usually happens due to:
- Rounding inconsistencies
- Manual edits to the G702
- Retainage miscalculations

The G703 should always be treated as the source of truth.

## 4. Incorrect Retainage Calculations

Retainage errors are extremely common and often subtle.

Typical issues include:
- Applying the wrong percentage
- Applying retainage inconsistently across line items
