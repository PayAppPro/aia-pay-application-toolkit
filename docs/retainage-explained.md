# Retainage Explained

**Retainage** (sometimes called retention) is a portion of payment withheld from each pay application to ensure project completion and proper closeout. It is a standard practice in construction contracts and directly affects how G702 and G703 pay applications are calculated.

Understanding retainage is critical to avoiding billing errors, cash flow issues, and disputes.

## What Is Retainage?

Retainage is typically:
- A fixed percentage of the value of work completed
- Withheld from each progress payment
- Released later, usually at substantial or final completion

Common retainage percentages range from **5% to 10%**, depending on the contract.

---

## Why Retainage Exists

Retainage is intended to:
- Encourage timely project completion
- Ensure correction of deficient work
- Provide leverage for final closeout items
- Protect owners from incomplete performance

While common, retainage significantly impacts contractor and subcontractor cash flow.

---

## How Retainage Is Applied

Retainage is usually applied:
- At the **line-item level** on the G703
- Based on work completed during each billing period
- Consistently across all pay applications

Some contracts:
- Apply retainage only to labor
- Exclude stored materials
- Reduce retainage after a certain completion percentage

Always defer to the contract language.

## Retainage and G703

On the G703 continuation sheet:
- Each line item tracks its own retainage
- Retainage is calculated as a percentage of completed work
- The retained amount is subtracted from the amount earned

Incorrect retainage math at the line-item level will cause G702 totals to be wrong.

---

## Retainage and G702

The G702 summarizes:
- Total retainage held to date
- Retainage from previous applications
- Retainage for the current period

Because G702 totals are derived from the G703, even small rounding errors can cause rejections.

---

## Partial Release of Retainage

Some contracts allow:
- Reduction of retainage after reaching a certain completion threshold
- Partial release at substantial completion
- Full release at final completion

When retainage rules change mid-project:
- The SOV remains the same
- Only the retainage percentage or application changes
- Consistency across all line items is essential

---

## Retainage and Stored Materials

Treatment of retainage on stored materials varies:
- Some contracts apply full retainage
- Some apply reduced retainage
- Some exclude stored materials entirely

This must be handled carefully to avoid overbilling or underbilling.

---

## Common Retainage Mistakes

- Applying retainage inconsistently across line items
- Forgetting to adjust retainage after approved reductions
- Applying retainage to excluded materials
- Manual math errors
- G702 retainage totals not matching G703 retainage totals

Most retainage-related rejections are caused by simple arithmetic mistakes.

---

## Best Practices

- Confirm retainage rules before the first pay application
- Apply retainage consistently across all line items
- Document any retainage reductions in writing
- Double-check math every billing cycle
- Reconcile G702 and G703 retainage totals before submission
